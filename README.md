## General info
In my learningJS series here on Git Hub I will showcase simple applications built mostly as a practice while learning JavaScript. Loan Calculator takes three parameters: loan amount, interest rate and years to repay. Based on choice about loan amortizaiton it will calculate monthly payment and totals for payment in general and interest. 

jQuery and Popper.js were loaded as Bootstrap dependencies.
